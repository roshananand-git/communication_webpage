        <h3><u>History</u></h3>
        <p>Chess began in India in the 6th century CE, named as “chaturanga,” meaning four divisions of an army. The game then spread to Persia, where it developed into “shatranj,” and from there it leapt to the Islamic world and, after several rounds of modifications, finally to Europe. Rules and pieces evolved over the centuries until finally maturing into the modern game in the 15th century.</p>

        <h3><u>Pieces</u></h3>
        <p>A game of chess is made up of 32 pieces, 16 for the white and 16 for the black players, of which there are two sets, usually in white and black. Each family comes with 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns. Each piece invariably has its own specific way of moving, and a numerical value (though in fact it can only be captured, and not make a move of its own, the zero being an exception to this rule).</p>
